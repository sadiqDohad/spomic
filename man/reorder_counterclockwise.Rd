\title{Reorder Coordinates Counterclockwise}
\usage{
reorder_counterclockwise(coords)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A numeric matrix or data frame with exactly two columns:
the first column for x-coordinates and the second for y-coordinates.}
}
\value{
A matrix or data frame of the same dimensions as \code{coords},
with rows reordered counterclockwise around the centroid.
}
\description{
Reorders a set of 2D coordinates so that they are arranged in a
counterclockwise order around their centroid.
}
\details{
This function:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates the centroid of all given coordinates.
\item Computes the polar angle of each point relative to the centroid.
\item Sorts the points by angle to produce a counterclockwise ordering.
}
